1. We do this to create a JavaScript variable in the code that we can later use when needed.
<!-- For example, when attaching events. Other layers can be made into variables accessed later when needed. -->

```js
console.log(fridaysAfterWork.features[1].properties.desc)
```
3. It seems as though onEachFeature is the solution here, but I'm not having much success getting it to work.

<!-- Make the route into a variable and attach a click event to it. -->
